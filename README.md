# Garbga-Damma(Tunisian game known as garbage or dramma)
first of all thd project is an application for in ai algorithm (minimax algorithm)
,this game is best application for this algorithm player against pc.
The main objective is to find the best move in all case

## Game description
This game needs two players and board each one should have 3 rocks (different from the rocks of the second player) 
The board have lines 
Each rock have number of possible moves 
Rocks move through lines

##More 
As we said the main idea is to predict best move "5arbga modele1" contain this algorithm
5arbga(predict best move)  contain the inerface 

The file contain all the code and the interface but with no control in the input of rocks(the rectangles )yet.
You can play the game but the front is not ready yet 
that is not a problem because this a good application for the minimax algorithm and this the idea
